## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a junior engineer currently building skills in working with APIs, handling JSON data, and formatting information for various applications. This repository is part of my journey to better understand how data moves between systems and how to structure it for readability, usability, and performance.

I work primarily on small-scale projects that involve making API requests, parsing JSON responses, and transforming data into formats that can be used by other parts of an application. Whether it's pulling information from third-party APIs, cleaning and reformatting data, or preparing structured outputs for front-end use, I enjoy the challenge of making raw data more meaningful and accessible.

In my current learning path, Iâ€™m focused on strengthening core skills like HTTP request handling, asynchronous programming, and building scripts or small tools that automate data transformation tasks. I also spend time learning best practices for organizing API logic, handling errors gracefully, and ensuring consistent data formatting.

This repository includes practice projects, utilities, and simple tools that reflect the practical skills Iâ€™m building. Each one represents progress in understanding the fundamentals of working with web dataâ€”from making API calls and iterating over JSON to formatting it into clean, usable structures like tables, charts, or UI components.

Iâ€™m always open to feedback and learning from others in the community. If youâ€™re also working with APIs and data, or if you have suggestions on how I can improve, feel free to explore the code, open issues, or connect.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to learning more about data, one API call at a time.
